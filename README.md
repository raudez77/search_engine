## Search Engines 

This is another End2End example of how to deploy and Search Engines
using keywords method and Asymmetric Search + transformers

The first model (Search by Keyword) it is just a function that filter 
values according to some condition, very simple but powerful.

The second model it is a bit more complicated because the Embedding process was done by using Transfer learning from a pre-defined model "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" from Transformer Libraries and then it compares the given sentence using cosine similarity. (Asymmetric Search)

## What I've learned

1. End to End Machine learning process.
2. Pipelines Wrapper .
4. Collaborate with other teams using Git GitHub - Docker  - Heroku
6. Understanding and Practicing CI/CD methodology. 
7. Transformers 
8. Pipelines Steps and Append

## How to download 

1. Copy / pull the repository. 
2. Download Dockerfile for production or .devop for your localhost.
3. Download all files.
4. Run train.py to check each step taken during the pipeline process.
5. Keep learning.
